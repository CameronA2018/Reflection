This week we learned how to find if a number is divisible by two with a remainder of 0, and how to make lists. Armed with our new knowled

So far this week, we learned about if statements, nested if statements, if elif else statements, and and or statements, and how to change text colors through coding. The homework was granted an extension for until next Monday, so there is no excuse for there not to be damn near perfection on it. Utilizing my knowledge from my Temperature code, and what we just learned, there is also no reason that I shouldn't be able to write the best code for this project. As the coding gets more difficult, it will be essential to really buckle down and work to stay ahead because soon we begin iteration, or loops. Also, I need to be able to balance time I take to get ahead in this class with studying for ACT, as my math scores need to come up a lot.

Over the course of this week we learned many different methods of splitting, slicing, reversing, copying and indexing strings. It was an easy week of learning, but the homework was the most challenging for me, yet. Particulary p2 in Hw4, which called for a program which took a single input of a first name, middle name, and last name in a single string, cut it, and then cut the middle name again to insert "-BOB-". The program also needed to convert all letters in all three names into capital letters, as well as reverse each name individually. p1 is simple as it calls for a simple .replace "\n", and p3 is just as simple as it calls for a simple rand.randint.

This week we reiterated the process of cloning a github repository then commiting, pulling, and pushing. I also accidentally learned about networking, particulary in the area of packets and packet construction and transfer. This week we had a quiz to asses our abilities and proficiency it regards to navigating ubuntu and utilizing markdown. Over the course of this next week we will be learning more about both. I look forward to doing this, as so far this has been easier than I thought it would. I am having an easy time picking up the process and language involved, and hope to be able to continue saying that over the course of the rest of the semester.

So far this week, we have learned about an interface called Putty, something that I'm fuzzy on called Ubuntu, and some trivial facts on Python. We've probably learned more than that, but this week has gone by as a blur due to lack of sleep and stress caused by the midterms and some of their attitudes. In no way is this a normal thing for me, and I will work uch more efficiently on homework and barracks duties for the rest of the year, as I will not have to deal with any of the complicated, three hour situations like I did last night. As a class we have learned how to access a virtual server, create and remove files and folders, and how to navigate the server. I am looking forward to working more with Ubuntu and coding.
