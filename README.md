# Reflection
## 1/26/2018


So far this week, we have learned about an interface called Putty, something that I'm fuzzy on called Ubuntu, and some trivial facts on Python. We've probably learned more than that, but this week has gone by as a blur due to lack of sleep and stress caused by the midterms and some of their attitudes. In no way is this a normal thing for me, and I will work uch more efficiently on homework and barracks duties for the rest of the year, as I will not have to deal with any of the complicated, three hour situations like I did last night. As a class we have learned how to access a virtual server, create and remove files and folders, and how to navigate the server. I am looking forward to working more with Ubuntu and coding.
