# Reflection 2
## 2/2/2018
This week we reiterated the process of cloning a github repository then commiting, pulling, and pushing. I also accidentally learned about networking, particulary in the area of packets and packet construction and transfer. This week we had a quiz to asses our abilities and proficiency it regards to navigating ubuntu and utilizing markdown. Over the course of this next week we will be learning more about both. I look forward to doing this, as so far this has been easier than I thought it would. I am having an easy time picking up the process and language involved, and hope to be able to continue saying that over the course of the rest of the semester.

# Reflection 1
## 1/26/2018
So far this week, we have learned about an interface called Putty, something that I'm fuzzy on called Ubuntu, and some trivial facts on Python. We've probably learned more than that, but this week has gone by as a blur due to lack of sleep and stress caused by the midterms and some of their attitudes. In no way is this a normal thing for me, and I will work uch more efficiently on homework and barracks duties for the rest of the year, as I will not have to deal with any of the complicated, three hour situations like I did last night. As a class we have learned how to access a virtual server, create and remove files and folders, and how to navigate the server. I am looking forward to working more with Ubuntu and coding.
